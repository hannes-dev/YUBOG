# YUBOG (Yet Unnamed BOmb Game)

This game is basically the same as 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes', but then in the browser.

## Architecture

The idea is that every module runs in an iframe within the main window; the modules can then communicate with the main window by using `window.parent.postMessage`.

## Event

(Date not yet determined): once we finished writing the framework, there will be a Zeus event where every participant will make a module and a part of the manual. At the end of the evening, we'll have a lot of modules and they'll all work together :tm:

## Hardware version

We also have a version of this in hardware: https://github.com/ZeusWPI/OBUS
